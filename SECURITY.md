# Security Policy

This repository contains the public documentation/specification for the TENC format. While there is no executable code here, we still welcome responsible disclosure of any security-relevant concerns in the specification or examples (e.g., guidance that could lead to unsafe implementations).

## Supported scope

- Clarifications to prevent insecure parsing/serialization practices
- Ambiguities that could lead to inconsistent or unsafe behavior across implementations
- Example corrections that mitigate misinterpretation

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use private disclosure. Do not open public issues with sensitive details.

1. Prepare a minimal, clear description of the concern and potential impact.
2. Contact the maintainers privately (Felix Orlov and Nick Medved).
3. If you do not have a private channel, open a short issue titled “Security: request private contact” without details. A maintainer will respond with next steps.

## Response & disclosure

- We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days.
- We will coordinate on clarifications or fixes to the documentation.
- Public disclosure will be coordinated once a resolution is agreed.

## Attribution

This documentation is released by Vorna Group LLC. Conceived and implemented by Felix Orlov and Nick Medved.
